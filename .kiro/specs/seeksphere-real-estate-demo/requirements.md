# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a demonstration real estate website that showcases the seeksphere node package capabilities. The website will feature property listings for rent and purchase, with two distinct search approaches: a traditional multi-step filter system and an advanced search powered by seeksphere. The project includes a data generation script to populate the database with over 20,000 property entries and a landing page explaining seeksphere and the demo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential user of seeksphere, I want to understand what seeksphere is and see a practical demonstration, so that I can evaluate whether it meets my search needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display an introduction to seeksphere with clear explanations of its capabilities
2. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation links to both search demonstration pages
3. WHEN a user reads the landing page THEN the system SHALL explain the difference between traditional filtering and seeksphere-powered search

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want to search for rental and purchase properties using traditional filters, so that I can find properties that match my specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the traditional search page THEN the system SHALL display a search interface with text input for initial search terms
2. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL return relevant property listings based on the search query
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide multiple filter options including property type, price range, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and amenities
4. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update the results in real-time to show only properties matching the selected criteria
5. WHEN a user views property listings THEN the system SHALL display essential information including title, price, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, and primary image
6. WHEN a user clicks on a property listing THEN the system SHALL display detailed property information including all images, features, and agent details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property seeker, I want to search for properties using seeksphere's advanced search capabilities, so that I can find properties through more intuitive and intelligent search methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the seeksphere search page THEN the system SHALL display a search interface powered by the seeksphere package
2. WHEN a user performs a search using seeksphere THEN the system SHALL return relevant results using seeksphere's advanced search algorithms
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show properties with relevance scoring or ranking provided by seeksphere
4. WHEN a user views seeksphere search results THEN the system SHALL display the same property information format as the traditional search for consistency
5. WHEN a user interacts with seeksphere search THEN the system SHALL demonstrate seeksphere's unique search capabilities compared to traditional filtering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating seeksphere, I want to see the system populated with realistic data, so that I can assess search performance and accuracy with substantial datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data generation script is executed THEN the system SHALL create over 20,000 property entries in the database
2. WHEN properties are generated THEN the system SHALL include realistic data for all required fields including addresses, prices, descriptions, and features
3. WHEN the database is populated THEN the system SHALL include diverse property types, locations across multiple provinces and cities, and varied price ranges
4. WHEN properties are created THEN the system SHALL include associated data such as agents, neighborhoods, property features, and images
5. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL populate all related lookup tables with appropriate reference data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of either search method, I want to view detailed property information, so that I can make informed decisions about properties of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any property listing THEN the system SHALL display a detailed property page with comprehensive information
2. WHEN viewing property details THEN the system SHALL show all property images in a gallery format with the primary image displayed prominently
3. WHEN on a property detail page THEN the system SHALL display all property specifications including size, features, pricing, and location details
4. WHEN viewing property information THEN the system SHALL show agent contact information and details
5. WHEN a property has price or status history THEN the system SHALL display relevant historical information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer implementing seeksphere, I want to see clean, well-structured code, so that I can understand how to integrate seeksphere into my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper integration patterns for the seeksphere package
2. WHEN reviewing the implementation THEN the system SHALL show clear separation between traditional search logic and seeksphere-powered search
3. WHEN studying the code THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and loading states for both search approaches
4. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL follow Next.js best practices and modern React patterns
5. WHEN inspecting the database integration THEN the system SHALL demonstrate efficient querying patterns for large datasets
